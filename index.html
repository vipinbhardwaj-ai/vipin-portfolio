    <h3>Cat vs Dog Image Classifier</h3>
    <p>
    Cat vs Dog Image Classifier (CNN):
This project is an image classification system based on deep learning using Python and Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN). This system differentiates images into two categories: cat images and dog images using a trained CNN model. The images were preprocessed and then trained using a CNN model with multiple convolution and pooling layers. The trained model was tested on images to check its accuracy and performance. This project has helped me understand computer vision and image preprocessing techniques. This project was done during my NASSCOM virtual internship program.
